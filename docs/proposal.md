# Project Proposal

## 1. Motivation & Objective

A flat surface can be more than just a surface. You can project onto it into a display. In this project we want to look at using everyday devices to turn a surface into touch sensor. More specifically, acoustic devices placed at the vertices pick up a touch event propagated through air and log the time of arrival. Using the time of arrival, we can solve the location of the touch event. This project involves two challenges, one is to solve the location of the touch location given time of arrival, the other is to make devices sync with each other to get accurate time of arrival.
