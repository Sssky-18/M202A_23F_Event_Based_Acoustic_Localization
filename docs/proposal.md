# Project Proposal

## 1. Motivation & Objective

A flat surface can be more than just a surface. You can project onto it into a display. In this project we want to look at using everyday devices to turn a surface into touch sensor. More specifically, acoustic devices placed at the vertices pick up a touch event propagated through air and log the time of arrival. Using the time of arrival, we can solve the location of the touch event. This project involves two challenges, one is to solve the location of the touch location given time of arrival, the other is to make devices sync with each other to get accurate time of arrival. 

## 2. State of the Art & Its Limitations

For implementing touch interaction on large surface, several ways are avaible and some of them are already commercially available. One way is to use a camera to track the touch event. However, it requires a camera to be placed above the surface and the camera needs to be calibrated. Also privacy can be harmed. Another way is to use a capacitive touch sensor. This is no different from any small touchscreen. But in the case of large surface, the cost and power consumption of the sensor can be high. Also, the sensor needs to be manufactured to adapt to the size. It is not plug and play. Another way is to use infrared pairs. By looking at which part has been blocked, we can infer the touch event. However, this method requires bulky hardware.
