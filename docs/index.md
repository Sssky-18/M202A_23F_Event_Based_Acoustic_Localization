# Abstract

This project employs the ALTo (Acoustic Localized Touch) approach to ascertain event locations. Utilizing acoustic signals captured by four or more microphones strategically positioned at varying angles on a common surface, the system calculates the time difference of arrival (TDOA) by analyzing signals associated with the same event. Leveraging the subtle time disparities among acoustic signals, the computational algorithm formulates hyperbolic equations to approximate and identify the event location.
